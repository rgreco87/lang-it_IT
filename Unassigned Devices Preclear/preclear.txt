You can use Unassigned Devices to clear the disk=

:preclear_general_help_plug:
> The Unassigned Devices Pre-clear can be used to prepare disks for inclusion in the array, clear disks for disposal, and perform stress tests before disks are used in the array.
>
> Only disks that are not being used in the array and have no partitions with file systems will be listed as candidates for pre-clearing.
>
> When a disk is being pre-cleared, you can follow the status on this page, on the Unassigned Devices page, or the pre-clear status icon in the footer of the Unraid web page.
> 
> There are multiple choices for pre-clearing:
>
> The **Enhanced** script authored by user **gfjardim** has the advantage that it supports the enhanced features like pause and resume pre-clearing. It also has extensive logging.
>
> The **Docker** option refers to the binhex Docker container that performs pre-clear. The advantage is that pre-clearing is isolated within the container.
>
> Pre-clear operations:
>
> + Clear Disk - The disk is cleared and the Unraid signature is written to the disk. This will create an empty partition on the disk.
> + Erase Disk - Erase the entire disk by writing all zeros. The pre-clear signature is removed.
> + Erase and Clear Disk - Random patterns are written to the disk and then zeros are written. This is a good choice for a disk to be discarded to ensure all traces of files are removed.
> + Verify Signature - The disk signature is checked.
> + Verify Disk - The disk signature is checked and the disk is verified to be zeroed.
> + Post-read Verify - Perform a post-read verify to check the disk.
> + Clear Signature - Remove the pre-clear signature from the disk.
>
> The text <em style='color:#00BE37;'>Pre-cleared</em> next to the disk serial number indicates that the disk has a pre-cleared signature. This will only show when the disk is pre-cleared and the Pre-clear Stats have been removed.
